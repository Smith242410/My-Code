# CONVERTER FUNCTION

Ever wanted to a code that could change a user's input to it own data type? Well, look no further cause this code does just that.

### The rules are as follows:
 - All input must be in form of string.
 
### While, the role it plays are:
 - Returns a string if a letter or special character is found (a-z, A_Z, :/;$,etc.)
 - Returns a float if a single period('.') and numbers are found 
 - Returns an integer if only numbers are found

Hope it is useful to you for your projects ðŸ˜‡
